# OpenCV-Projects üëÅ 
USING COMPUTER VISION

OpenCV library allows us to make use of inbuilt method and functions that help us develop real world project from just ideas on a paper. We have develop three different innovative projects, Face Recognition, Driver Drowsiness Detection and Virtual Drawing Board.

We are students of Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering Pune.

To run the code :
  1. Setup a Virutal Environment.
  2. Install all the required libraries.
  3. Check for all the required paths and files.
  4. Run with a device supporting web cam.
